    "content": "\n            A man found frozen in a Pennsylvania cave in 1977 has finally been identified, closing the book on a nearly 50-year-long mystery.\n     \n            The Berks County Coroner\u2019s Office identified the remains of the missing man as Nicholas Paul Grubb, 27, from Fort Washington, Pennsylvania.\n     \n            Surprisingly, advanced technology played no role in identifying the \u201cPinnacle Man,\u201d a moniker inspired by the peak in the Appalachian Mountains near where Grubb was found.\n     \n            Instead, Berks County Coroner John Fielding told reporters at a Tuesday news conference that a Pennsylvania State Police detective discovered the missing link to the cold case the old-fashioned way, by digging through files.\n     \n            On January 16, 1977, hikers found a man\u2019s frozen body in a cave just below the Pinnacle, in Albany Township, the Berks County Coroner said at the news conference.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            During the autopsy he was unable to be identified based on his appearance, clothing or belongings, according to George Holmes, chief deputy coroner of Berks County. The cause of death, according to Holmes, was determined to be a drug-induced overdose. There were no signs of trauma to Grubb\u2019s body suggesting foul play, the coroner\u2019s office said.\n     \n            Dental records and fingerprints were collected from the man\u2019s body during his autopsy, according to Holmes, who added that the fingerprints were misplaced.\n     \n            More than 42 years passed before authorities revisited the cold case, according to CNN affiliate WFMZ, which r after dental records linked him to two missing person cases in Florida and Illinois.\n     \n            Berks County forensic experts performed an exam in 2019, and DNA samples were taken to update his record in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, or NamUs. But they did not match the two missing person cases, the coroner\u2019s office said.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Fast-forward to early August, when there was a major break in the cold case. Ian Keck of the Pennsylvania State Police found the lost fingerprint card from Grubb\u2019s 1977 autopsy.\n     \n            Keck submitted the fingerprint card to NamUs on August 12, according to Holmes, and within an hour an FBI fingerprint expert matched the Pinnacle Man\u2019s fingerprints to Grubb\u2019s.\n     \n            One of Grubb\u2019s family members was notified by the Berks County Coroner\u2019s Office, who confirmed Grubb\u2019s identity. The family member asked the office to place his remains in the family plot.\n     \n            \u201cThis identification brings a long awaited resolution to his family, who have been notified and expressed their deep appreciation for the collective efforts that made it possible. It is moments like these that remind us of the importance of our work to provide answers, to bring closure and to give the unidentified a name and a story,\u201d Fielding said.\n    "

    "content": "\n     \n \n            As kids head back to school, many schools aren\u2019t allowing them to bring their phones to class.\u00a0  to ban phones in schools has been proposed or passed in many cities and states. Most schools already have policies prohibiting them for nonacademic use, according to the  .\n     \n            Parents often question\u00a0these policies because they want to be able to reach their kids in an emergency such as a school shooting.\n     \n            Yet research suggests it\u2019s not just a good idea for kids to put their phones away while in class \u2014 they shouldn\u2019t bring them to school at all.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Some 97% of 11- to 17-year-olds use their phones during school time, for an average of 43 minutes, according to  . If they\u2019re checking their phones between classes or at lunch and recess, they\u2019re likely preoccupied with what they\u2019re seeing on their screens and therefore spending less time talking, playing or even just hanging out with their friends.\n     \n            Such preoccupation is not healthy because, as social psychologist Jonathan Haidt wrote in \u201c ,\u201d one of the most important things young people should be doing is playing with peers.\n     \n            In doing so, they learn to navigate social dynamics and build skills by figuring out how to do different activities. It teaches them they can handle other challenges they\u2019ll face in the future, which Haidt said can help protect them from anxiety.\n     \n            But phones aren\u2019t just intruding on kids\u2019 time outside class. In a June Pew Research Center  , 72% of public high school teachers said cell phone distractions are a major problem in their classrooms. If children are sneaking peeks at their phones, they can\u2019t possibly be paying attention to what they\u2019re supposed to be learning. A wide body of evidence tells us the human brain   \u2014 we can only do one thing at a time.\n     \n            One indicator that students aren\u2019t learning as much at school as they did in the pre-phone era is scores on the ACT \u2014 a standardized test that measures whether they have the English, reading, math and science skills needed for first-year college courses.  , ACT scores dropped to  , according to the organization that administers the test.\n     \n            As a professor who has taught at five universities since 2010, I\u2019ve witnessed this trend myself. When I first started teaching, before smartphones became ubiquitous, many of my students arrived better able to concentrate and work through long reading passages than they are now.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Of course, it\u2019s easy to imagine how kids will respond if we ask them to leave their phones home: They\u2019ll promise not to check them during the school day. Unfortunately, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect them to fight the urge to look at products that are  , with features such as bottomless scrolling and continuous notifications. The average teen gets 237 phone notifications a day on their phones, according to the   \u2014 with a quarter coming in during the school day.\n     \n            Sending kids to school sans smartphones forces them to concentrate on what\u2019s happening in front of them rather than on their screens. That\u2019s another important skill to learn.\n     \n            \u201cThe phone-based life makes it difficult for people to be fully present with others when they are with others, and to sit silently with themselves when they are alone,\u201d Haidt warned.\n     \n            What\u2019s more, the idea that having a phone with them makes kids safer is often a myth.\n     \n            Phones can be dangerously distracting to teens. At one of my recent talks at a private school, the school psychologist told parents she regularly sees their children walk out of school looking at their screens while crossing the streets of Manhattan. So, phones may cause emergencies in the first place.\n     \n            Of course, if children have a crisis on the way home from school, in most places in the United States, there will be businesses and people around with phones who will be willing to let them call their parents.\n     \n            Similarly, while many parents wish they could reach their children in the unthinkable event of a school shooting, kids will be safer if they remain quiet and focused on the instructions they receive from school administrators or law enforcement.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            In addition, children often have extraordinarily dangerous experiences on their phones. In August, a report by Thorn, a nonprofit that combats child sex abuse,   that the great majority \u2014 59% \u2014 of youth said they\u2019ve had online experiences that have been potentially harmful. One in 3 minors and 1 in 5 preteens said they\u2019d had online sexual experiences with someone they thought was an adult, according to the report.\n     \n            It\u2019s true that letting kids bring phones to school can make coordinating things like pickups after extracurricular activities easier. If children truly need a phone to communicate with their parents \u2014 perhaps because they have a medical condition and need to be able to reach someone in an emergency or because their pickup arrangements are so complicated that a time and location can\u2019t be set in advance \u2014 one option Haidt   is an old-fashioned flip phone. Having one lets them text or call but not log on to social media apps.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Sending kids to school with smartphones is unlikely to make them smarter or safer. It\u2019s more likely to distract them and make them unable to focus on learning.\n     \n            Without a phone, kids can focus on interacting with peers, learning and being fully present in their surroundings \u2014 rather than having these things compete for their attention with influencers and internet memes.\n     \n               .\n    "

And it just brings out the best in me. And you guys are unbelievable fans, and it makes it so fun out here, honestly.\u201d\n     \n            But when Chris Eubanks \u2013 an American tennis player who is friends with Tiafoe and is currently working for ESPN after losing in the first round on August 26 \u2013 tried to wrap up the on-court interview, Tiafoe took the microphone, saying, \u201cHold on.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cTony Goldwyn was in the crowd,\u201d Tiafoe said, referencing the actor. \u201cYo, I\u2019m a huge fan of you, bro. Me and my girl used to watch \u2018Scandal\u2019 all the time. I\u2019m a huge fan brother, I\u2019m a huge fan, bro. I\u2019ve got to say that.\u201d\n     \n            Now that Tiafoe has that box checked, he\u2019ll be looking ahead to the quarterfinals.\n     \n            Tiafoe will face No. 9 Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria. Dimitrov, the oldest man left in the draw at 33, defeated No. 6 Andrey Rublev in the round of 16, getting past the Russian 6-3, 7-6(3), 1-6, 3-6, 6-3 in three hours, 39 minutes.\n     \n            Dimitrov, who reached the US Open semifinals in 2019, is 3-1 in his career against the 26-year-old Tiafoe.\n     \n            It was the first time Tiafoe and Popyrin \u2013 who had upset Novak Djokovic in the third round \u2013 had played each other.\n     \n            Popyrin gave respect to Tiafoe, the No. 20 seed, applauding his friend\u2019s forehand winner on match point. They then embraced at the net.\n     \n            \u201cObviously beating Novak is a huge win at any point, any time, no matter where, when,\u201d Tiafoe said to reporters of Popryin. \u201cI kind of feel like Alexei had the level. He showed it tonight. It was a really, really high level. So I had to come up with great stuff.\u201d\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Popyrin told reporters he thought Tiafoe \u201cwas the better player no matter how close it was\u201d and that the American \u201cstepped up on the bigger points.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cHe\u2019s playing some scary tennis,\u201d the 25-year-old Popyrin said. \u201cIf he continues it, he has a really good chance.\u201d\n     \n            No American man has won a grand slam singles title since Andy Roddick won the US Open in 2003.\n     \n            At the 2022 US Open, Tiafoe gave fans hope he might end the US men\u2019s grand slam singles title drought, shocking Rafael Nadal in the round of 16 and upsetting Rublev in the quarterfinals. His run ended in the semifinals, falling to the eventual champion,  .\n     \n            Tiafoe is one of two American men so far that have reached this year\u2019s US Open quarterfinals. Joining him is No. 12 Taylor Fritz, who came back from a set down to defeat No. 8 Casper Ruud 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 earlier Sunday.\n     \n            \u201cI think, in the past, I\u2019ve been very, very excited, very happy to make quarterfinals at slams,\u201d said Fritz, 26, who advanced to his fifth grand slam quarterfinal of his career, including now at the US Open in back-to-back years.\n     \n            \u201cI think I\u2019m at the point now where I\u2019m still happy to make quarterfinals, but I wouldn\u2019t be happy with it ending here. I definitely am at the point where I really want more than that.\u201d\n     \n            Up next for Fritz will be No. 4 Alex Zverev of Germany, who was runner-up at this year\u2019s French Open and runner-up at the 2020 US Open. On Sunday, Zverev beat unseeded American Brandon Nakashima 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2.\n     \n            At Wimbledon in the fourth round against Zverev, Fritz came back from two sets down to win in five. All time, Zverev is 5-4 against the American.\n     \n            \u201cWe\u2019re in a quarterfinal of a grand slam stage. I think there\u2019s no easy matches from now moving forward,\u201d Zverev said.\n     \n            One American remains on the opposite half of the draw: No. 14 Tommy Paul will face world No. 1 Jannik Sinner on Monday in the fourth round.\n    "

More than 10,200 hotel workers at dozens of hotels stretching from Boston to the West Coast to Hawaii went on strike early Sunday morning.\n     \n            \u201cI walked out today because we just cannot keep working paycheck to paycheck, not able to pay our bills,\u201d Jerome Roberts, a dishwasher at the Hilton Baltimore Inner Harbor said in a statement. \u201cGoing on strike is hard, but not nearly as hard as trying to get by on what we are getting paid. We told the bosses in our negotiations how much we are struggling right now but they didn\u2019t care. We are on strike to make them pay.\u201d\n     \n            Workers say they want higher pay, better conditions and more staff to help. The union is asking for a restoration of many of the pandemic-era cuts that hotels made, including daily room cleaning. The union says the travel and hotel industries have recovered from the pandemic but worker salaries have not reflected the comeback.\n     \n            The hotels are reportedly still open but guests are contending with a skeleton staff unable to provide full services.\n     \n            \u201cWe\u2019re on strike because the hotel industry has gotten off track,\u201d Gwen Mills, International President of Unite Here, said in a statement Sunday morning. \u201cDuring Covid, everyone suffered, but now the hotel industry is making record profits while workers and guests are left behind. Too many hotels still haven\u2019t restored standard services that guests deserve. Workers aren\u2019t making enough to support their families. Many can no longer afford to live in the cities that they welcome guests to.\u201d\n     \n            The hotel chains facing striking workers include Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott. The hotels have 23,776 rooms between them in the cities of Baltimore, Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, as well as Honolulu and Kauai in Hawaii, and Greenwich, Connecticut, according to the union.\n     \n            The union is threatening to possibly expand the strike to as many as 65 hotels in 12 different cities, possibly adding hotels in Oakland, California, as well as Providence, Rhode Island, and New Haven, Connecticut. Spokespeople for Hilton and Hyatt told CNN on Friday they are committed to reaching deals with the union, but they also will continue to serve customers during any work stoppage.\n     \n            Hyatt said in a statement it is disappointed by the union\u2019s decision to\u00a0strike. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to negotiate fair\u00a0contracts and recognize the contributions of Hyatt employees,\u201d said Michael D\u2019Angelo, head of labor relations at Hyatt.\n     \n            Last year, the 15,000 members of the same union   during the Fourth of July holiday weekend at 65 hotels in Los Angeles and Orange counties in Southern California.

Now, new photos taken this summer show that the view has changed dramatically.\n     \n            The latest expedition by RMS Titanic Inc., an American company with salvage rights to the wreck, has revealed that a section of the previously intact railing around the front of the ship\u2019s upper deck has fallen off. The 15-foot-long section now lies on the sea floor, directly below where it once was.\n     \n            \u201cWe are saddened by this loss and the inevitable decay of the Ship and the debris,\u201d the company said in a   on its website.\n     \n            \u201cOver the course of the next few weeks and months, we will conduct a more thorough review of Titanic\u2019s condition and her changes over time,\u201d it continued.\n     \n            \u201cAlthough Titanic\u2019s collapse is inevitable, this evidence strengthens our mission to preserve and document what we can before it is too late,\u201d it added.\n     \n            The July expedition, the company\u2019s ninth since it first visited the wreck 1987, involved ocean imaging experts, oceanographers, scientists and historians working together to capture new images of the wreck to review its condition, identify artefacts and areas at risk, and contribute to ongoing conservation efforts, according to the company.\n     \n            More than two million photos were taken, and the team searched for numerous artefacts.\n     \n            This search yielded an exciting discovery.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            On the final day of the expedition, the team found and photographed a two-foot-tall bronze statue of Diana, the Roman goddess of nature and hunting.\n     \n            The statue, which once sat atop the fireplace mantle as a centrepiece in the Titanic\u2019s First Class lounge, was ripped away and thrown into the wreck\u2019s debris field when the lounge tore open as the ship sank, according to the company.\n     \n            While the figure was photographed in a 1986 expedition, its location remained unknown until this latest expedition due to a tradition of secrecy surrounding the Titanic\u2019s wreck, the company said.\n     \n            Much of the art that decorated the halls and rooms of the ship \u201cwas made of organic materials, breaking down into the earth after many decades submerged in the hostile environment\u201d of the ocean, the company said Sunday in an   on the statue.\n     \n            However, Diana \u201cis still resting upright among miles of debris. Like the eternal Roman deities, she is timeless\u2013-and she is rediscovered thanks to Expedition 2024,\u201d it added.\n     \n            As scientists race to preserve its history, the legendary wreck is slowly perishing.\n     \n            In 2019,   by an exploration team from Triton Submarines revealed the effects of salt corrosion, metal-eating bacteria and deep current action on the decomposition of the ship.\n    "

Its wearer, of course, was Ella Emhoff, Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 stepdaughter and potential next first daughter of the US. \u201cMy brain is always under the assumption it\u2019s not that big of a deal,\u201d Ando told CNN via Zoom from his home in Brooklyn, New York. \u201cShe needs a dress and she wears it, and people will watch this event but it won\u2019t really be about what she\u2019s wearing. But this was so public.\u201d\n     \n            The dress was deemed   by streetwear and fashion blog Highsnobiety, while   whether it solidified Emhoff as one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s next fashion ambassadors.\u201d The 25-year-old\u2019s gown seemed to embody a new era of power dressing \u2014 one where women don\u2019t need to dress masculine in order to look and feel strong. \u201cI wanted her to stick out, but in a way that was still very elegant and distinguished, and not obnoxious,\u201d said Ando, who said the dress took between 70 and 90 hours to make. \u201cWe wanted it to feel like an elegant tea party\u2026 a modern princess moment.\u201d\n     the dress has been SERVED \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\ude2d @smellaemhoff  \n            But Ando didn\u2019t see the final look until it was broadcast live on TV, since his and Emhoff\u2019s schedules aligned for just one midnight fitting before her morning flight to Chicago. \u201cShe did the fitting with us at midnight, then there were like four hours worth of edits that had to be made,\u201d he said. \u201cI went back to my studio, got it to her at 7 a.m. and then I only got to really see if those edits worked when she walked on stage.\u201d\n     \n            Outfits by independent designers can sometimes be found on political campaign trails, for those keen-eyed enough to spot them. Eschewing the traditional names of Ralph Lauren, Carolina Herrera and Oscar de la Renta, smaller brands can help those in the limelight to communicate nuanced messaging by supporting emerging talent. At the 2021 inauguration of President Joe Biden, Harris arrived in a Pyer Moss camel coat by Kerby Jean-Raymond \u2014  . First Lady Dr. Jill Biden regularly made a point of wearing smaller, homegrown New York-based designers such as Markarian and Adam Lippes during a time when the industry was recovering from the fallout of COVID-19.\n     \n            Not only did Emhoff, who is a knitwear designer herself, choose to wear an independent label on the final day of the convention; she had a heavy hand in the finished product. \u201cIt was super collaborative,\u201d said Ando, who usually receives minimal feedback from his clients. \u201cBut with her, she was very involved.\u201d He sent her several skirt silhouette variations and every fabric option, no matter how slight the difference. \u201cShe wanted to see everything. She gave a lot of time to it and was a big part of the design, honestly.\u201d\n     \n            Before he was designing for the family member of a presidential nominee, Ando was fashioning one-of-a-kind dresses for any celebrity he could find. Armed with a tiny mic, a bashful attitude and an impressive  , Ando filmed himself approaching celebrities asking if he could make them a dress. His videos feature everyone from actors Dakota Johnson to Rachel Zegler and Keke Palmer. What ensues is a homespun montage of his sewing process, and often followed by a gratifying try-on reveal.\n     made a dress for Dakota Johnson\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f@Madame Web in theaters everywhere @Sony Pictures    \n            While he still posts his clumsy dressmaking advances onlines, in reality most of Ando\u2019s work today comes from direct requests made by movie studios and record labels. He also has a lot of clients that he can\u2019t talk about. \u201cA lot of celebrities have a lot of things to worry about,\u201d he said. \u201c(They) have contracts with big fashion brands where a lot of the time they can\u2019t wear other brands at risk of being sued. There\u2019s so many moving parts.\u201d Not every A-lister is up to the task of appearing in one of his TikTok videos either. \u201cFor those people, as nice as they are and as gracious as I am that they hired me to do stuff, they might not want to dance in front of a camera. And that\u2019s so reasonable.\u201d\n     \n            Most young designers get their start through traditional runway shows, with only a lucky few going on to dress celebrities for the odd red carpet event. Ando, by contrast, has built an impressively starry client roster and millions of followers before even launching a brand. (His namesake label will eventually launch in Spring 2025). \u201cYeah, we did it flipped,\u201d he said.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            While Emhoff\u2019s princess frock spawned headlines across the internet, many attributed the look simply to \u201cThat TikTok Guy\u201d \u2014 a reduction that doesn\u2019t seem to bother Ando. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be Rick Owens,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even need you to know my name. I just want you to see the thing and hopefully you appreciate it.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cPeople might not take me seriously. I\u2019m very insecure about that,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it\u2019s also the most important thing, because people not taking me seriously allows me to just fully dive in. Like if they\u2019re not going seriously to respect me, I kind of have nothing to lose.\u201d\n    "

In doing so, the podcast reached a huge audience and set off a true-crime podcasting boom as well as further examinations of the case, including the HBO docuseries, \u201cThe Case Against Adnan Syed.\u201d\n     \n            In two separate dissents, three members of the Maryland Supreme Court expressed disagreement with the majority\u2019s decision to reinstate the conviction.\n     \n            Writing in one, Judge Michele Hotten said that under Maryland law, Young Lee \u201chad no right to be heard at the vacatur hearing.\u201d\n     \n            \u201dThe circuit court is not statutorily required to hear from a victim or victim\u2019s representative during vacatur proceedings because those proceedings no longer concern punishing the criminal defendant; rather, those proceedings concern the very basis of the criminal defendant\u2019s guilt \u2014 conviction,\u201d she wrote in the dissent\n     \n  CNN\u2019s Christina Maxouris, Sara Smart, Dakin Andone and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.\n"

If federal elections were held now, recent polls show the AfD could become the second-largest group in the Bundestag, with the SDP trailing in third.\n     \n            Scholz described the results as \u201cbitter\u201d and, calling on the European principle of the \u201ccordon sanitaire,\u201d urged mainstream parties in Thuringia and Saxony to exclude the AfD from any state governing coalitions.\n     \n            \u201cAll democratic parties are now called upon to form stable governments without right-wing extremists,\u201d Scholz said in a statement. \u201cOur country cannot and must not get used to this.

It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n     \n            Alice Weidel, co-leader of the AfD, told German public broadcaster ARD that the results were a \u201crequiem\u201d for Scholz\u2019s coalition and questioned \u201cwhether it can continue to govern at all.\u201d\n     \n            Speaking to CNN at a campaign rally in the city of Erfurt in Thuringia, where chants of \u201cdeport, deport\u201d rang out across the room, Weidel said that Germany has become \u201ca country without borders, where anyone can come in and we do nothing about it.\u201d\n     \n            The AfD\u2019s solution? \u201cThe immediate expulsion of all illegal immigrants from our country. All criminals, all extremists must leave,\u201d she said.\n     \n            If other parties heed Scholz\u2019s call to shun the AfD, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) \u2013 the mainstream center-right party projected to come first in Saxony and second in Thuringia \u2013 would be well-placed to benefit. However, in a sign of the rightward shift of Germany\u2019s politics, the CDU has recently taken a far harsher line on immigration than under its former leader Angela Merkel.\n     \n            Founded in 2013, initially in opposition to the euro and the German-backed bailout of southern European countries during the eurozone crisis, the AfD has since coupled its rhetoric of economic grievance with a staunch opposition to immigration.\n     \n            The issue of immigration became more salient \u2013 and the AfD more popular \u2013 after then-Chancellor Merkel allowed into the country more than 1 million refugees in 2015, mostly those fleeing civil war in Syria.\n     \n            While the decision won her praise from Europe\u2019s more liberal mainstream, it has provided a rallying cry for extremist parties in Germany\u2019s formerly communist east, where economic growth is more anemic and opportunities more scarce than in the richer west.\n     \n            \u201cThere\u2019s a much more anti-political sentiment in East Germany, which has its roots in the transformative years of the 1990s\u201d after the collapse of communism, Johannes Kiess, a sociologist at the University of Leipzig specializing in far-right extremism, told CNN. Mainstream parties perform less well in the east, creating space for anti-establishment parties like the AfD and political entrepreneurs like Wagenknecht.\n     \n            Just days before the state elections, a   stabbed three people to death and wounded several others at a festival in the western Germany city of Solingen. Weidel pinned the blame solely on Germany\u2019s migration policy: \u201cInstead of racking our brains over the various models of knife bans, we must finally tackle the problem at its roots. Migration change immediately.\u201d\n     \n            The message is also winning the support of some young Germans. The movement has even acquired its own anthem, after a video filmed on the German vacation island of Sylt showed well-dressed youths chanting \u201cAusl\u00e4nder Raus\u201d (\u201cforeigners out\u201d) and \u201cDeutschland den Deutschen\u201d (\u201cGermany for Germans\u201d) over a 1999 Eurodance beat. The chant swirled across the country as it hosted the European soccer championships earlier this summer.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            At the campaign in Erfurt, Kevin Flurschutz, a 21-year-old public transport engineer who recently joined the youth wing at the AfD, told CNN that immigration had become his foremost concern. \u201cHardly anyone dares to go out anymore. To be honest, I find that sad,\u201d said Flurschutz, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with, \u201cWhite boy summer.\u201d\n     \n            Carolin Lichtenfeld, another 21-year-old attendee, said she\u2019d experienced harassment on the streets. \u201cYou notice it on public transport. You notice it when you go shopping,\u201d she told CNN.\n     \n            Both Lichtenfeld and Flurschutz have joined the Young Alternative (JA), the youth wing of the AfD which has been designated by German authorities as a \u201cconfirmed extremist\u201d organization. The main AfD has been designated as \u201csuspected extremist.\u201d\n     \n            The party\u2019s lead candidate in Thuringia,  , was convicted earlier this year after breaking German laws against uttering Nazi slogans in public.\n     \n            Kiess, the sociologist, said sections of the German public are becoming more tolerant of extremists like H\u00f6cke. \u201cTwenty or 30 years ago, we would have said, \u2018This is a neo-Nazi, a fascist, and you cannot vote for a guy like that.\u2019 But people don\u2019t care anymore,\u201d Kiess said.\n     \n            While the AfD\u2019s growing popularity is for many reminiscent of the country\u2019s darkest political era, H\u00f6cke has campaigned on a platform of national pride untainted by historical guilt, under the banner of \u201cHeimat\u201d (\u201chomeland\u201d).\n     \n            \u201cYes to freedom, yes to the community, yes to the youth, yes to the future, yes to our Heimat, Thuringia and Germany,\u201d he said at the campaign in Erfurt.\n     \n            That message is taking root in the fertile ground of Germany\u2019s east, where voters told CNN they felt neglected by traditional parties. \u201cThe AfD is the only alternative we have left here in Germany,\u201d said Flurschutz.\n    "

    "content": "\n     \n \n            It is indisputable that many of us spend much of our lives in front of our screens \u2013 especially our phones.  \n     \n            What\u2019s also indisputable is that some of those activities can take us down a spiraling, time-suck rabbit hole. \n     \n            In fact, 31% of US adults and 46% of US teens say they are on the internet \u201calmost constantly,\u201d according to Pew Research Surveys from  and  .   \n     \n            How much is too much? Sometimes it\u2019s hard to know. But sometimes, the answer is much more obvious. It was for Jerome Yankey. He was a college freshman when he noticed that his use of social media, specifically TikTok, had become problematic.  \n     \n            \u201cIt just kind of started to really wear on me physically first, I think, because that was when I was just scrolling for hours, not going to sleep \u2013 it was taking hours out of my day. I wasn\u2019t really doing much else in my free time,\u201d he explained. \n     \n            When the toll shifted from physical to mental, quashing his creativity and warping his sense of worth, he decided he needed to quit. And he did it cold turkey \u2013 no easy feat. \n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Yankey is far from alone. The 2022 Pew Research Survey of US teens found that 67% of them use TikTok, and among those,   That number is even higher among the 95% of teens who use YouTube, with 19% using it \u201calmost constantly.\u201d    \n     \n            For now, internet addiction is not an official clinical diagnosis. There are still a lot of questions about whether it qualifies as a mental health disorder on its own or whether it should be considered part of another mental health condition. There are also questions about how to define it, measure it, test it and treat it.  \n     \n            Most experts do agree, though, that regardless of whether it is a true \u201caddiction\u201d or something else, too much screen time can have bad effects, especially for kids. \n     \n            That\u2019s where Dr. Michael Rich comes in. A self-described \u201cmediatrician,\u201d Rich treats young patients with what he calls problematic media use at the   (which he co-directs) at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            \u201cWhere the problem comes in is when their day-to-day functions are impaired in some way,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not getting enough sleep. They are overeating. They are missing school or falling asleep in school. They are withdrawing from their friends.\u201d  \n     \n            He likes to stay away from the addiction model.  \n     \n            \u201cWe as a society use the term addiction as pejorative. We think of addicts as weak people with weak character \u2026 and we approach addiction, frankly, still as something to be punished rather than healed,\u201d he said. \n     \n            Rich also doesn\u2019t think technology is the cause of his patients\u2019 problems, but rather, it amplifies them. And he has a counterintuitive approach to helping his young patients, who are often coping with other issues \u2013 like anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder or just plain old stress. Listen to how they learn how to wean themselves off their devices and adopt a healthier relationship with their electronics. \n     \n   \n"

She died from strangling or suffocation, and suffered a blow to her head, police said, citing an autopsy report. She also had been sexually assaulted, according to court documents provided by prosecutors.\n     \n            Silzel was last seen three nights earlier leaving a pizza shop where she worked on the weekends to supplement her income as a full-time training supervisor for Boeing, police said.\n     \n            Friends and colleagues requested a welfare check at Silzel\u2019s home after she had not reported to work at Boeing for two days, which was highly unusual, according to police.\n     \n            Although DNA technology was not advanced enough to identify a suspect at the time, DNA evidence was collected during the initial investigation, police said.\n     \n            Investigators with the Washington State Patrol crime lab built a DNA profile from the evidence for an unknown man they called Individual A, according to police.\n     \n            In 2016, advancement in DNA technology allowed investigators to obtain a partial DNA profile from the victim\u2019s bathrobe at the crime scene that matched the DNA profile of Individual A, police said.\n     \n            Investigators compared multiple DNA samples throughout the years to the partial DNA profile, but none matched Individual A, according to police.\n     \n            A breakthrough finally came in 2022, when crime lab investigators used   to identify 11 possible suspects, police said. That forensic method compares unidentified DNA to DNA that can be found in genealogy databases, potentially allowing researchers to find relatives of the unknown person. That, combined with  , can help investigators identify potential suspects.\n     \n            The  has been used in recent years to crack some of the nation\u2019s coldest cases, including the arrest of the\u00a0 \u00a0in 2018.\n     \n            In the Washington case, investigators began collecting DNA samples from the potential suspects to compare to Individual A\u2019s DNA profile, Kent police said.\n     \n            Two of the potential suspects were Kenneth Kundert and his brother, both living in Arkansas, police said\ufeff.\n     \n            \u201cIn September 2023, Kent (detectives) began to look into the (brothers) and were advised that they were both in custody for an unrelated assault,\u201d Kent police said in a news release.\n     \n            Kent police coordinated with a sheriff\u2019s office in Arkansas to request voluntary DNA samples from the brothers, according to police. While Kundert\u2019s brother gave his sample willingly, Kundert declined, Kent police said.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            DNA testing proved the brother was not a match, police said.\n     \n            Police discovered Kenneth Kundert had ties to Washington state. He and his brother had lived in an apartment complex about 1,200 feet from where Silzel\u2019s condominium, police said. Court documents from prosecutors say the brothers lived at the complex at the time of Silzel\u2019s death.\n     \n            Looking for evidence Kundert was at the scene of Silzel\u2019s killing, Kent police in March traveled to Clinton, Arkansas, where they kept tabs on him with the help of the FBI and local law enforcement officers, they said.\n     \n            During that surveillance, they picked up a cigarette butt that Kundert discarded, police said in a probable cause affidavit. A crime lab report indicated the DNA profile from the cigarette butt belonged to Individual A, according to the affidavit.\n     \n            Kundert was being held Thursday at an Arkansas county jail, according to jail records. He he was awaiting extradition to Washington state, police said.\n     \n            Kundert is charged in Washington\u2019s King County with first degree murder, court documents show. Bail has been set at $3 million.\n     \n            CNN is trying to determine whether Kundert has obtained an attorney. No attorney was listed in court documents or in online court records.\n     \n            Silzel was originally from Manden, North Dakota, where she graduated from high school and worked for a school district, Padilla said. She lived in the Seattle area for about 12 years before her death.\n    "

And the nation\u2019s top doctor agrees.\n     \n            US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, a\u00a0 , issued an   on Wednesday that the pressure that parents are under has become a public health problem. Some 41% of parents reported they can\u2019t function most days because of stress, and 48% said they\u2019re completely overwhelmed by stress, the advisory said, citing a 2023   survey.\n     \n            Parents are struggling with the high costs of childcare, education and health care, the advisory warned. They\u2019re straining to find enough time for work, childcare and the mental load of parenting. They\u2019re worried about school shootings and the mental health challenges many children are facing.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            They\u2019re also challenged by how to handle kids\u2019 use of social media and their own, because parents are facing an \u201cintensifying culture of comparison\u201d encouraged by social media influencers showing off their supposedly perfect parenting, according to the advisory.\n     \n            Things are even worse for parents with added stressors, such as those who are single, have children with special needs or have recently divorced.\n     \n            And if parents are stressed, kids get stressed. Children were twice as likely to have behavioral, developmental or mental disorders and four times likelier to have poor mental health when their primary caregiver had poor mental health, according to a 2021  .\n     \n            It\u2019s no surprise that parents\u2019 mental health struggles can hurt our whole society by driving up health care costs and lowering economic productivity, the advisory noted.\n     \n            \u201cSimply put, caregivers need care, too,\u201d the advisory warned.\n     \n            It\u2019s true that lot of these problems require action by lawmakers and employers, and this advisory should serve as a wake-up call to both that health care and childcare should be more affordable and accessible.\n     \n            In the meantime, what can parents do? Anna Seewald, a psychologist and host of the \u201cAuthentic Parenting\u201d podcast, told me parents can make changes to protect their physical and mental health amid all these challenges.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Our society makes life incredibly hard for parents, the advisory noted, so parents could try to reevaluate their expectations of themselves.\n     \n            \u201cParents put a lot of pressure on themselves to always be calm and patient and have well-behaved kids who do a lot of extracurricular activities,\u201d Seewald said, but she noted doing so often isn\u2019t realistic. \u201cHigh expectations and social comparisons lead to big resentments and frustration.\u201d\n     \n            It\u2019s better for parents to be realistic about what they can do given their circumstances.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Many parents who work with Seewald are spending loads of time on social media. Even deleting a single app can free up a substantial amount of time and energy, she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice how they drain your time, but that\u2019s a background stressor for a lot of people in a world of many stressors \u2014 and it\u2019s one that you can control.\u201d\n     \n            Parents can also benefit from simplifying their kids\u2019 activities. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to two different birthday parties for 4-year-olds in a single weekend,\u201d she said. \u201cPreserving and protecting your own energy and time is more important.\u201d If it\u2019s something you\u2019d enjoy, \u201cmaybe you hire a babysitter for an hour, maybe you invite a neighbor over for coffee,\u201d she said.\n     \n            One way for parents to find more time for themselves is to ask for help from the community \u2014 such as asking a kind neighbor or family member to watch their kids so they can take a break. Seewald said it\u2019s also important for parents to think through what responsibilities \u2014such as laundry or carpooling \u2014 they can delegate to other people.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Part of the time parents devote to themselves needs to include connecting with other people in person, Seewald said. \u201cSo many parents feel lonely and isolated. Seeing a friend helps you vent and talk about problems and get the emotional support you need, even if it\u2019s limited and you see one person each week,\u201d she said.\n     \n            Parents can meet some self-care needs even with their kids around \u2014 and with small pockets of time, Seewald said. \u201cIf you put on music and dance with your kids and are silly for 10 minutes before you make dinner, your mood changes because of the movement,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle interventions like that make a big difference, and they\u2019re free.\u201d\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            Spending time in nature also helps, she said. \u201cYou can go to the backyard or to a park, even if it\u2019s for 15 minutes, even with kids, and feel the sun or watch the sunset. There\u2019s no cost, but it regulates the nervous system and gives you a sense of awe and connects you to something bigger,\u201d she pointed out.\n     \n            Above all, Seewald recommended that parents practice self-compassion, which means \u201cbeing kind and gentle with ourselves when we make mistakes, when we yell at our kids,\u201d she said. \u201cFeeling inadequate and shameful is a recipe for failure.\u201d\n     \n            The surgeon general has made clear that parents in the United States are not OK. While it\u2019s on lawmakers and employers to solve many of these problems, it\u2019s also critical for parents to practice self-care instead of waiting for the problems to be fixed. (That\u2019s going to take awhile). Being kind and realistic with themselves, finding time to connect with friends and nature, and asking for help are all ways to help manage the mother lode\u00a0of stresses parents are under.\n     \n               .\n    "

However, some revealed mixed emotions, as 44% of the teens surveyed said they feel anxious when they\u2019re without their phones.\n     \n            Still, the report notes that \u201ca minority of teens \u2013 ranging from 7% to 32% \u2013 say they often feel\u201d anxious, upset or lonely when they\u2019re \u201cphone-less.\u201d\n     \n            And more than two thirds of teens say they believe the benefits of smartphones outweigh the harms for people their age. \u201cMore teens believe smartphones make it easier, rather than harder, to be creative, pursue hobbies and do well in school,\u201d the report states.\n     \n            A larger portion of the teen respondents (42%), however, said they believed smartphones make it harder to learn good social skills.\n     \n            The American Psychological Association   that teens undergo training before they start using social media, saying the tools are \u201cneither inherently harmful nor beneficial\u201d for young people but that they should have instruction in social media literacy and psychological development to minimize potential harms.\n     \n            Many parents also say they are keeping tabs on their teens\u2019 smartphone and social media use, with half of parent respondents reporting they\u2019ve looked through their children\u2019s phones, particularly parents of younger teens. (And in most cases, their children seem to know it: 43% of teen respondents said their parents had looked through their phones.)\n     \n            Parents these days have more tools than ever to monitor their kids\u2019 online experience. Many social media platforms have responded to criticisms over youth safety by launching so-called   and other features to allow parents to oversee how their teens are using the platforms, while maintaining some privacy for their kids.\n    "

    "content": "\n     \n \n            Teens get as many as 237 or more notifications each day  , according to a new report.\n     \n            \u201cSmartphones have become an always-on,   in the lives of young people,\u201d said Dr. Jenny Radesky, a coauthor of the   by Common Sense Media \u2014 a nonprofit organization that helps kids, parents and schools navigate media \u2014 in  .\n     \n            \u201cBecause the industry has failed to offer young people better options for managing their smartphones, teens are working hard to be savvy about design features and how to set boundaries,\u201d added Radesky, who is also division director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the University of Michigan C.S. Mott Children\u2019s Hospital and co-medical director of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Center of Excellence on Social Media and Youth Mental Health..\n     \n             \n     \n            The report\u2019s findings are based on the Android smartphone use of about 200 11- to 17-year-olds who let their data be collected via software, and on feedback about the data from Common Sense Media\u2019s Youth Advisory Council, which is comprised of young people who help interpret data to understand the relationships young people have with their phones.\n     \n            About one-fourth of notifications came during school hours, a finding researchers said suggests phones and apps could improve on cutting down unnecessary alerts at times when teens shouldn\u2019t be disrupted \u2014 especially because, during school hours, most participants used their phone at least once for 43 minutes on average. But some teens used their phones for more than six hours during that time.\n     \n            \u201cI work with teenagers and young adults for about 40 hours a week. \u2026 This research bears itself out 100%,\u201d said John Duffy, a Chicago-based psychologist who wasn\u2019t involved in the report, via email. \u201cEven during therapy sessions, teenagers receive notifications at an astonishing clip, sometimes dozens of times per session.\n     \n            \u201cWhereas a lot of adults might turn off notifications or shut their phones off while in class or an important meeting or while doing homework, teenagers tend to keep them on,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cAn impulse pulls them toward looking at every single notification. As a result, their attention is scattered.\u201d\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            The research backed this up, finding that teens\u2019 smartphones were their \u201cconstant companion that encourages regular pickups,\u201d amounting to checking their phones more than 100 times daily on average and feeling they couldn\u2019t put them down.\n     \n            Most participants also looked to their phones   and found it hard to disengage from stimulating apps such as TikTok \u2014 which was used by participants for nearly two hours on an average day, but more than seven hours for some.\n     \n            \u201cThe algorithm for TikTok is just way more addicting,\u201d one Youth Council member said in the news release. \u201cIt draws you in more.\u201d\n     \n            Another Youth Council member, who is in 11  grade, thinks \u201cwe\u2019d all feel a lot better if we were on it less,\u201d they said. \u201cWhen I lost my phone \u2026 I didn\u2019t have a phone for a week, and that week was amazing. Just not having a phone, it takes this weight off of you. It almost sets you free in a way.\u201d\n     \n            Duffy said excessive phone use and the pressure to respond, which some teens experienced, can be anxiety-provoking and stressful even if teens aren\u2019t aware of it, adding to this is the fact that teens\u2019 notifications aren\u2019t just from friends, social media, sports or celebrity gossip, but also school shootings and other tragic events.\n     \n      \n       \n       \n     \n            The findings make \u201cabundantly clear that teens are struggling to manage their phone use, which is taking a serious toll on their ability to focus and overall mental health,\u201d said James P. Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, in the news release.\n     \n            Adults could do more to help teens and children   for phone use, experts said. \u201cYoung people need more support from family members and educators, as well as clear guardrails from the technologists who are intentionally designing these devices to be addictive, at the expense of kids\u2019 well-being,\u201d Steyer said.\n     \n            \u201cI encourage parents and teenagers that I work with to turn off notifications and only look at them a few times a day,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cFor most teenagers, that\u2019s between four or five times. Any less frequently, and they get anxious that they might be missing out on something that is relevant to them.\u201d\n     \n            The report also included participants\u2019 insights on how they try to balance their phone use, such as avoiding picking up their phone at all during school hours lest they inadvertently spend more time on it than they should. Some teens also use \u201cdo not disturb\u201d features \u2014 which are often customizable \u2014 that collect notifications for users to check later without having to hear or see alerts immediately.\n     \n            \u201cFor me, my parents were concerned about my phone usage time for a while, but any time they tried to put the restriction, it didn\u2019t really work out that well,\u201d one participant in 10th grade said. \u201cBut when I put on my own restrictions \u2026 they have been lasting a lot longer and actually worked.\u201d\n     \n            Some of the teens whose phone use   schedule started putting their cell in another room at night. In the report, Common Sense Media encouraged parents to help teens consider which apps keep them alert before bed and which ones calm them down, so that if phone use happens before bed, it\u2019s at least a less harmful form. For kids who use their phones to decompress after school, parents can also help them learn to achieve this in other ways.\n     \n            \u201cOur brains operate at their best when the cognitive load \u2014 or the amount of information the brain is working to process \u2014 is low,\u201d said Dr. Neha Chaudhary, a child and adolescent psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital and chief medical officer at Modern Health, a mental health care platform for companies supporting their employees, via email.\n    "

Now, in New York at the   and unseeded, she\u2019s once again reminding the world what kind of player she is when at full fitness: dangerous \u2013 and a threat to go deep into the fortnight.\n     \n            Muchov\u00e1, with a game she says was partially inspired by Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, has reached the fourth round after a 6-4, 6-2 win against Russian Anastasia Potapova on Saturday.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s easy for me to be motivated,\u201d Muchov\u00e1, currently ranked No. 52, told reporters. \u201cAnd to playing on these big events, it\u2019s just why I play tennis and what I play for.\u201d\n     \n            Muchov\u00e1\u2019s next opponent is just one of two women\u2019s players to make the second week of every grand slam this year: That would be Italy\u2019s Jasmine Paolini, who defeated Yulia Putintseva of Kazakhstan 6-3, 6-4 Saturday. (The other woman to reach the second week in every major this year is defending US Open champion  , who is on the opposite half of the draw.)\n     \n            Muchov\u00e1 was a semifinalist at the 2023 US Open, losing to Gauff and rising to a career-high No. 8 in the world at the time. She also was a finalist at the 2023 French Open, a semifinalist at the 2021 Australian Open, and a two-time quarterfinalist at Wimbledon (2019 and 2021).\n     \n            But after her run to the semifinals at the US Open a year ago, she shut things down and underwent wrist surgery, not returning until late June at Eastbourne. She\u2019s also previously had back, abdominal and ankle injuries.\n     \n            \u201cGoing far, well, at the start of the tournament? Zero thoughts about that, honestly,\u201d Muchov\u00e1 said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to expect from myself.\n     \n            \u201cI mean, I didn\u2019t play much this year, so I was just trying to be focused on the first match. That\u2019s usually the trickiest one. Really, really grateful and happy that I made it now to the fourth round.\n     \n            \u201cI feel better each match actually, so it\u2019s nice to get some matches under belt. I\u2019m, again, happy that I will have a chance to play another match here.\u201d\n     \n            Muchov\u00e1 has demonstrated some fantastic serve-and-volley tennis in New York, including in her straight sets win in the second round against four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka. Her   during her first-round win against Katie Volynets is in the running for the shot of the tournament \u2013 maybe even shot of the year.\n     \n            Meanwhile, Paolini\u2019s breakthrough year just keeps getting better.\n     \n            Before 2024, the 28-year-old Italian had never made it past the second round of any grand slam tournament. It\u2019s a completely different story now.\n     \n            Paolini, ranked a career-high No. 5 with her recent success, has the most grand slam singles match wins by a woman in 2024 with 18, and reached back-to-back grand slam finals at the French Open and Wimbledon. She also won the gold medal in women\u2019s doubles at the   with her compatriot Sara Errani.\n     \n            \u201cThis year has been amazing. \u2026 Now I made second week in every slam,\u201d Paolini said to reporters.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s crazy if they told me at the beginning of the year before the Australian Open, that I don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s a really good moment for me. I hope to, as I say, always to keep this level as much as possible. I\u2019m really having fun playing at this level. I really enjoy (it).\n     \n            \u201cThis is I think what I was dreaming of to play at this level with this consistency in these kind of tournaments, stadiums with a lot of people. It\u2019s really nice to be in this position.\u201d\n     \n            Muchov\u00e1 leads the career head-to-head against Paolini 3-0, but they haven\u2019t played each other since 2021. Both players showed their respect for each other on Saturday.\n     \n            \u201cYou can see that she really improved a lot. \u2026 Roland Garros, I was following actually, and I\u2019m a fan of hers,\u201d Muchov\u00e1 said of Paolini.\n     \n            \u201cShe did an incredible job and playing finals on clay and then grass in Wimbledon. It\u2019s just pretty inspiring. Yeah, she\u2019s (a) very nice girl. So, yeah, I was supporting (her).\u201d\n     \n            Said Paolini of Muchov\u00e1: \u201cI\u2019m a fan of her. She\u2019s playing unbelievable. I really love how she plays. She can play every shot, slice, volleys, serve and volleys. She\u2019s a very complete player, I think, a very tough opponent.\n     \n            \u201cI hope we can play a really, really good match.\u201d\n     \n            Their fourth-round match will take place Monday.\n    "

After the year he\u2019s had, can anyone really blame him?\n     \n            The world No. 1 capped off a year in equal parts historic and haywire with triumph at the season-ending   on Sunday, cruising to a four-shot victory in Atlanta.\n     \n            Having begun the week with a two-stroke lead at the summit on 10-under par, a reward for his position atop the FedEx Cup standings, the American eased around East Lake with a closing four-under 67 to beat compatriot Collin Morikawa to the $25 million winner\u2019s cut of a $100 million prize purse.\n     \n            It marks the first time since Tiger Woods in 2007 that a player has tallied seven wins in a PGA Tour season, a haul made even more impressive when you add in the  , a newborn son and the   that headlined Scheffler\u2019s stunning campaign.\n     \n            \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve lived almost a full lifetime in this one year,\u201d Scheffler told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s been nuts.\u201d\n     \n            \u201cI\u2019m exhausted right now,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s really no other way around it. I\u2019m just really, really tired.\u201d\n     \n            Scheffler\u2019s starting advantage at East Lake was his reward for a stellar campaign.\n     \n            The 28-year-old looked almost unbeatable during a prolific early season run, becoming the first player   before   in April \u2013 just one week on from   at Augusta National \u2013 made it four wins in five starts.\n     \n            His greatest prize followed mere weeks later, as wife Meredith gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child, Bennett. Their son arrived just in time for the  , where the Texan was subsequently arrested amid remarkable scenes in Louisville.\n     \n            The tournament favorite had   after he was arrested driving around a police roadblock outside Valhalla Golf Club. Though the week ended in frustration on the course, with Scheffler finishing eight shots behind  , all  .\n     \n            Scheffler rebounded to add two more wins at the Memorial Tournament and Travelers Championship respectively before a stunning   last month saw him clinch Olympic gold.\n     \n            \u201cI think when you hear people chanting \u2018U-S-A\u2019, even though it\u2019s been over a month now since it happened \u2026 It\u2019s pretty cool,\u201d Scheffler said.\n     \n            \u201cI take a lot of pride in being an American, so it was pretty fun to bring home that gold medal. As far as the year goes, I really don\u2019t know how to put it into words.\n     \n            \u201cYou had the one weird spot there at Valhalla \u2013 I just don\u2019t really know what to say about it \u2013 but everything else has been pretty special,\u201d he added.\n     \n            It looked set to be a procession before Scheffler made a string of uncharacteristic errors towards the end of his front nine, starting with a skewed drive at the seventh that left him needing to escape from under a tree.\n     \n            That led to a bogey that was replicated at the following hole when the leader shanked his effort from a greenside bunker, opening the door for a flying Morikawa to move within two strokes.\n     \n            Fittingly for the season, any murmur of tension was immediately wiped out by Scheffler, who rattled off three consecutive birdies before lasering in for eagle at the par-five 15th to canter home ahead of world No. 4 Morikawa.\n     \n            \u201cJust nothing fazes him,\u201d Morikawa, who pocketed $12.5 million, reflected to reporters about Scheffler.\n     \n            \u201cWhether I was close in gaining some ground or he was gaining ground, it didn\u2019t change how he walked, how he played or how he went through every shot. That\u2019s something to learn. I think his mental game is a lot stronger than a lot of people know.\n     \n            \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what he\u2019s been able to do for this entire season and over these past three years. It\u2019s been really cool to watch him, and hopefully, I can draw something from that.\u201d\n     \n            Attention for both Morikawa and Scheffler will now turn to the Presidents Cup, with both players automatically qualified for US captain Jim Furyk\u2019s team that will take on Mike Weir\u2019s international side at Royal Montreal Golf Club in Quebec, Canada, on September 24.\n     \n            Scheffler was part of a  , two years ago but struggled individually, losing three of his four matches.\n     \n            \u201cEmotionally right now, I\u2019m pretty drained, so I\u2019m looking forward to going home and getting rest for a week or so before I start prepping for the Presidents Cup because that\u2019s a tournament that I really want us to go out there and win,\u201d Scheffler said.\n    "
